# NewsFlow

![NewsFlow icon](./image/newsflow-icon.svg)

> AI-assisted newsroom workflow for event tracking, evidence organization, approval chains, correction handling, and post-publication monitoring.

NewsFlow is not just an AI writing tool. It is a newsroom workflow system designed to support the middle of the reporting process: lead intake, event clustering, evidence structuring, claim review, risk checks, sign-off decisions, correction handling, and post-publication follow-up.

中文简介：NewsFlow 不是一个只围绕“自动写稿”的 AI 工具。它更关注新闻生产中真正高成本、也更高责任的中间流程：线索进入、事件归并、证据组织、Claim 结构化、风险暴露、签发审批、勘误流转，以及发布后的监测与知识回写。

## Why this project exists

Most AI products for journalism focus on output: drafting, rewriting, summarizing, or style transfer. NewsFlow focuses on a different problem: the hidden coordination and judgment costs that sit before and after the final text.

It is built around a simple belief:

- the hardest part of responsible news work is often not writing itself
- the real cost sits in organizing evidence, judgment, risk, and handoff across roles
- if AI enters this space, it should make the process more visible and reviewable, not less accountable

## What makes NewsFlow different

| Dimension | General AI writing tools | NewsFlow |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Core object | Text | Events and Story Packets |
| Main task | Generate or rewrite copy | Organize workflow, evidence, and approval |
| Human role | Final editor | Embedded decision-maker at key checkpoints |
| Risk handling | Often left to the end | Brought forward into workflow nodes |
| Post-publication loop | Usually missing | Monitoring, correction, and knowledge write-back |

### Workflow and task detail

## Best suited for

- self-hosted product exploration
- newsroom workflow demos and teaching
- full-stack prototype extension
- experiments around human-in-the-loop review, approval traceability, and editorial governance

## Current status

- End-to-end frontend and backend are in place
- Core objects, workflow stages, and key review pages are implemented
- Suitable for self-hosting, demos, and secondary development
- Still closer to a high-fidelity prototype than a production-ready newsroom platform

## Core agents

| Agent | Responsibility | Stage |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- |
| Source Monitor | Multi-source lead intake and 5W1H extraction | Input |

## Key capabilities

### Input side

- RSS, API, and manual intake
- deduplication and event clustering
- automatic risk grading
- editor-facing triage suggestions

### Cognition side

- 5W1H extraction
- Claim Card generation
- evidence verification
- relationship mapping

### Governance side

- multi-stage redaction gates
- PII detection
- source-protection boundaries
- traceable audit logs

### Production side

- AI-assisted drafting
- channel adaptation
- semantic drift checks
- platform rule checks

### Approval flow

- state-machine-driven workflow
- multi-stage sign-off
- SLA awareness
- explicit human gates

## Quick start

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

- copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
- copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local`

### 3. Start backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. Start frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Visit the app

- frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 6. Notes

- frontend uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to connect to the backend
- default local API URL is `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` if you want to enable LLM-backed features
